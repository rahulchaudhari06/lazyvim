# ðŸ’¤ My Lazy Vim Starter Configuration

A starter template for Neovim using [Lazy Vim](https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim) that has been slightly customised by yours truly.
The ultimate goal is to make Neovim a fully versatile IDE, which obviously involves a substantial amount of tinkering and custom plugins.

Refer to the official [documentation](https://lazyvim.github.io/installation) to gain better understanding.

## Installation

1. Make a backup of your current configuration files.

```sh
mv ~/.config/nvim ~/.config/nvim.bak
mv ~/.local/share/nvim ~/.local/share/nvim.bak
```

2. Clone the repository and start the IDE.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/rahulchaudhari06/lazyvim ~/.config/nvim
nvim
```
